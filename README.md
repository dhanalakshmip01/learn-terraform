  - `init`
  - `plan`
  - `apply`
  - `destroy`

### Hands-On
- Create first `main.tf`
- Initialize Terraform (`terraform init`)
- Run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`
- Destroy resources safely

### Outcome
You understand **how Terraform works internally**.

---

## 📅 Day 3 – Terraform Language (HCL) Basics

### You Will Learn

- File structure and naming best practices

### Hands-On
- Write clean Terraform configuration
- Reference resource attributes
- Use `terraform console`

### Outcome
You can **read and write Terraform code confidently**.

---

## 📅 Day 4 – Variables in Terraform (Deep Dive)

### You Will Learn
- Input variables
- Variable types (string, number, bool, list, map, object)
- Default values
- `terraform.tfvars`
- Variable precedence
- Local values (`locals`)

### Hands-On
- Convert hardcoded values into variables

---

## 📅 Day 6 – Resources & Meta-Arguments

### You Will Learn
- Resource lifecycle basics
- Meta-arguments:
  - `count`
  - `for_each`
- Difference between `count` and `for_each`

### Hands-On
- Create multiple resources using `count`
- Repeat using `for_each`
- Compare behaviors

### Outcome
You can **scale resources dynamically**.

---

## 📅 Day 7 – Dependencies & Lifecycle Rules
